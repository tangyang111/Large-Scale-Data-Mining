======================= Environment & Dependencies ========================
Coding Environment:
	Python 2.7.14

Package:
	1. numpy v1.14.0
	2. matplotlib v2.1.2
	3. sklearn v0.19.1
	4. nltk v3.2.4

=============================== Instruction ===============================
Each .py file solves one question and can be run seperately to get results
in console output.

- Q1.py:    for question 1. You can run it directly and get TFxIDF matrix of
            8 subclasses.

- Q2.py:    for question 2. You can run it directly and get the contingency
            table and 5 measures scores by applying K-means clustering algorithm.

- Q3_i.py:  for question 3-i. You can run it directly and get the plot of 
            percentage of variance retained with number of principal components
            r increasing from 1 to 1000.

- Q3_ii.py: for question 3-ii. You can run it directly and get the 5 measures
            scores and contingency tables for 9 r values.

- Q4_a.py:  for question 4-a. You can run it directly and get the clustering
            visualization figures with truncated SVD and NMF methods respectively.

- Q4_b.py:  for question 4-b. You can run it directly and get the clustering 
            visualization figures and contingency tables with applying 3 
            improvement transformations. 

- Q5.py:    for question 5. You can run it directly and get the figures of 
            5 measures scores, contingency tables and clustering visualizations 
            on 6 classes with different reduction dimension techniques and 
            different dimensions.

- all .ipynb files can be run directly on Jupyter Notebook and get the 
results below.
